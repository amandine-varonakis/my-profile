			<h1>Hello, I am Amandine!</h1>

			<p>I am a final-year student involved in a double-degree program in Management and Political Sciences. I have a wide ranging knowledge in Digital Marketing, Event Organisation and Evaluation of Public policies. I am currently looking for an end-of-studies internship in Europe starting in January. </p>
			<p>I recently created a website called "Portraits de génération" to allow young people to share important moments of their life and to deconstruct stereotypes about their generation. </p>

			<h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
			<p>I am currently enrolled in a Master's Degree in Digital Marketing at Audencia, a French Business School.</p>

			<h2>Event organisation</h2>
			<p>In 2018, I realised a first internship at Amaris, an international Consulting Group. My role was to coordinate different types of events such as career fairs, networking events and workshops in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Colombia and Mauritius. </p>

			<h2>Evaluation of Public Policies</h2>
			<p>Besides my interest in Marketing, I have also developped a strong interest in Policymaking and Public Affairs. That is why, last year, I have been studying the Evalution of Public Policies at Sciences Po Rennes, a french institute of Political Sciences. </p>
